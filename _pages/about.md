I help executives to translate their artificial intelligence dreams into deployed solutions. I moved from software security consultant expert back to academia in 2013, when I decided to shift my field to machine learning and the like. At the begging of my AI journey, I found myself stuck to security data, modeling anomaly detection in a project with Brasilian Army, but I may say that such task outcomes were much timider when compared with AI applied to the Brasilian judiciary system as I've been experiencing in projects like VICTOR (Brasilian Supreme Court), ALEI (Federal Court), Mandamus (State Court), and so.
